1. In your opinion, what’s helpful about version control systems? What’s annoying about them?

Pros
-- Easy to share code and collaborate among individuals and teams
-- Tracking changes in feature development, limitations and defects
-- Restoring to a previous version
-- Tracking change history


2. What are some pros and cons of using Docker to develop, test, and deploy software?

Pros
-- Lightweight, container based architecture
-- Hassle free for environment setup, quick OS spin up
-- Requires less memory space
-- Easier to ship same code across different environments like sandbox, testing, staging and production
-- Efficient for continuous integration and deployments

Cons
-- Copying files from image to host
-- Lack of gui can be hectic for some users
-- Lack of monitoring for container processes

3. How do you choose which language to use for a given task? How did you choose the language for the programming exercise above?

I chose python because there are already libraries avalible to handle large datasets like pandas and numpy. Also almost no setup was required to get started and make a working script.
